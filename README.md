# Hangman-Android-Game
Uses http://hangman-api.herokuapp.com/api.<br />
Still has a few things to add to it, like drawing the already existing in memory list of wrongly guesses letters to the user and changing the "*Guess letter*" button to *"Restart game."* once a the poor man is hanged. <br />
Maybe i'll add user's logins, ranks, and a "Start game" button to the currently empty ***MainActivity*** via Firebase.
